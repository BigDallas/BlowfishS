## Summary
Crippled by a mountain of student debt and desperate for a fresh start, a recent college graduate devises a wild plan to turn his life around - by creating his own religion. Inspired by the lavish lifestyle of the town's charismatic priest, this quirky, relatable underdog sets off on a hilariously chaotic adventure that snowballs beyond anything he ever imagined. What starts as an innocent, if misguided, attempt to chase a better future quickly spirals into a comical and unpredictable journey filled with absurd twists, moral dilemmas, and unexpected revelations.

In May 2024, I stepped onto a film set as an actor for the first time playing the role of Ginger. 

The entire Cast and Crew was increible, supportive, professional, and fun to be around. I had an absolutly great time start to finish.

Can't wait for the next time I get to work with them!
