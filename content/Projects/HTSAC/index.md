Crippled by a mountain of student debt and desperate for a fresh start, a recent college graduate devises a wild plan to turn his life around - by creating his own religion. Inspired by the lavish lifestyle of the town's charismatic priest, this quirky, relatable underdog sets off on a hilariously chaotic adventure that snowballs beyond anything he ever imagined. What starts as an innocent, if misguided, attempt to chase a better future quickly spirals into a comical and unpredictable journey filled with absurd twists, moral dilemmas, and unexpected revelations.
